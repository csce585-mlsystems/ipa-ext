# Inference Pipeline Adapter (IPA) Extension Project

A CSCE 585 - Machine Learning Systems Project

# Contributions

- `experiments/runner/run_revision_perf.sh` script runs the experiments in `experiments/runner/run-revision.sh` using perf to measure Energy consumption of each experiment
- Energy measurement logs are saved in `energy_logs`
- `experiments/runner/run_revision_perf_plot.py` script generates plots for energy benchmarks of workloads and plots are saved in `images/plots`
